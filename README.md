### Past Work

**Rap Battle Game**

<img width="900" alt="" src ="Images/Shop UI">
<img width="900" alt="" src ="Images/Taunts UI">

I made the Shop and _Taunt UI and I also scripted the front and back end of it. I created the equipping, purchasing, and unequiping system. Everything is written using OOP so new items and functionality can be added easily.

<img width="900" alt="" src ="Images/Settings UI">

I designed the Setting UI and scripted it to adjust all client side music volume.

The video above showcases the fully functional Shop, Taunts, and Settings UI. The Shop UI has smooth purchasing, equipping, and unequipping mechanics. The Taunts UI is shown to have an easy equiping and unequipping system. All UIs communicate cleanly for smooth transitions. 

<img width="900" alt="" src ="Images/Robux Shop UI">

I designed and scripted the Robux Shop UI. It is fully functional on the client and includeds a special method for customizing how gamepasses and developer products load. The server securely saves and loads purchased items. It displays owned and unowned products and uses a product class that allows developers to easily add rewards without worrying about players missing out if they already onw a gamepass.

It includes polished animations for purchases and product rewards. The system is modular and can be added to any game within minutes. It also notifies the player when an error occurs to reassure them.

The video above shows the fully functional Robux Shop, including product loading, purchase flow, and satisfying purchase feedback.
