### Past Work

**Rap Battle Game**

<img width="900" alt="" src ="Images/Shop UI">
<img width="900" alt="" src ="Images/Taunts UI">

I made the _Shop_ and _Taunt_ UI and I also scripted the front and back end of it. I scripted the equipping, purchasing, and unequiping system. I also made sure that everything was OOP so that way you can easly add more items and change the functionalty of the system easly.

<img width="900" alt="" src ="Images/Settings UI">

I designed the _Settings_ UI and scripted it to change the volume of all music on the client.

The video above shows the fully functional _Shop, Taunts, and Settings_ UI. The _Shop_ UI has smooth purchasing, equipping, and unequipping mechanics. The _Taunts_ UI is shown to have an easy equiping and unequipping systen. It shows how each of the UIs are able to cummunicate to have smooth transitions. 

<img width="900" alt="" src ="Images/Robux Shop UI">

I designed the _Robux Shop_ UI and scripted it. The UI is fully functional on the client and has special method to customize the way gamepasses and dev products load. The system has been securely made on the server to save and load the player's purchased gamepasses and products. It displays what the player has purchased and not purchased, and it has a product class that allows the devs to easly add rewards to gamepasses without worrying that players the already own the gamepass will missout. It has great animations when the player is prompted a purchase and when they recive the product. The system is modular as you can add it to any game within minutes it is fully functional. It also can notify the player when an error occured to help reassure them.

The video above shows the fully functional Robux Shop. It shows product loading, functional purchases, and shows a very sastisfying purchased result.
